# Go + Vue.js Full-Stack Engineering Curriculum

## What is this folder?
A challenge-based curriculum for building production-grade full-stack services. You learn by shipping — not by reading slides.

Every phase from Phase 5 onward builds **Handoff** — an on-call incident handoff platform. The curriculum and the project are the same thing. See here [`fullstack-engineering-curriculum.md`](./fullstack-engineering-curriculum.md)

## What is Handoff?

In teams practicing YBIYRI ("You Build It, You Run It"), the engineers who write the code carry the pager. When an incident outlasts the individual — fatigue after hours of firefighting, cross-team escalation, timezone handover — one engineer's accumulated context needs to reach another engineer intact, under pressure, during an active incident. In practice it doesn't. It lands in Slack as fragments.

Handoff captures timestamped actions as the engineer works and generates a structured brief for the next person: what was done, what's still broken, where to start.
